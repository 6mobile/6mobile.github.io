<p>The goal of this lab is to implement code in the Anteater app to scan
for a nearby Anthill, connect to it, and stream temperature and humidity
readings from it. We have provided you with all of the code to show
sensor readings in a table in the UI, and to plot sensor readings on a
chart, but you will need to implement all of the networking code, and
the code to extract sensor readings from packets sent by the
Anthill.</p>
<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Start by downloading the <a
href="codes/lab1/anteater-swift-4.2-xcode11.zip">Anteater App Skeleton
for Xcode 11+/iOS 13+</a>. Uncompress this file to create a directory
called "anteater-swift-blank". Open the anteater.xcodeproj file in this
directory in XCode. You should be able to build and run the project in
the simulator or your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Known issue for Xcode 11+/iOS 13+:</strong> when you build
and run the app in your iPhone for the first time and try to log in with
any username, the app may crash. Simply build and run again. The app
should skip the log-in screen without any error.</p>
<p>The Anteater code includes a skeleton class,
<code>SensorModel.swift</code> that you will need to implement. The
<code>SensorModel</code> class will implement <code>BLEDelegate</code>
and initialize an instance of <code>BLE</code> to handle interaction
with the device. In addition, to convey the status of a sensor
connection, <code>SensorModel</code> will make calls into a delegate,
which implements the <code>SensorModelDelegate</code> protocol defined
in <code>SensorModel.swift</code>. The methods of the delegate are as
follows:</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>func sensorModel(_ model: SensorModel, didChangeActiveHill hill: Hill?)
func sensorModel(_ model: SensorModel, didReceiveReadings readings: [Reading], forHill hill: Hill?)</code></pre>
<p>These methods let the application know when a new sensor connects, or
when some data is received.</p>
<p>The code also includes a complete implementation of the class
<code>HillsTableViewController</code>, which creates an instance of
<code>SensorModel</code> and sets itself as the delegate of that
instance.</p>
<p>For <strong>iOS 13+</strong>, please make the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select your project from the navigator panel and then highlight the
Build Settings tab. Filter the settings or locate “Other Linker Flags”
from this list and then add “-ObjC -all_load” to these settings. (See <a
href="images/lab2/build_settings_linker_flags.png">this screenshot</a>
for reference.)</li>
<li>Select “Info.plist” from the navigator panel and add a property
“Privacy - Bluetooth Always Usage Description” with value “Bluetooth
required”.</li>
</ul>
<p>This lab is divided into two sections. In the first section, you will
implement the code to scan for and connect to an anthill, and then in
the second section you will implement the code to extract readings from
packets sent by the anthill and deliver them to the app.</p>
<p>To test this lab, you will need to obtain an anthill node. Note that
the bluetooth functions you will implement do not work properly on the
iPhone simulator, so you will need to test on a real device. If you are
working with a partner, please check out only one anthill as we have a
limited number of them. Please do not throw the box away.</p>
<p>The anthill you receive will have a sensor and a USB Micro port. To
power the anthill, it will need to be powered over USB to your laptop,
or to any other USB charger, as shown below:</p>
<center>
<img src="images/lab2/circuit.jpg" width="450" />
</center>
<p>The pins between the BLE node and sensor should be connected as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(+)</strong> on sensor to <strong>+3V3</strong> on BLE node
(Be careful, not D13!)</li>
<li><strong>(-)</strong> on sensor to <strong>GND</strong> on BLE
node</li>
<li><strong>S</strong> or <strong>out</strong> on sensor to
<strong>D8</strong> on BLE node</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two <strong>GND</strong> pins in total. If one does not
work, try using other pins.</p>

<h2 id="sec1">Section 1: Connecting to an Anthill</h2>
<p>The goal of this section is to successfully establish a connection
with an anthill. In the next section you will extract data from packets
sent by the anthill.</p>
<p>Before working on this section, you should familiarize yourself with
the basics of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the iOS APIs for accessing
it. This <a
href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/CoreBluetoothOverview/CoreBluetoothOverview.html">Apple
Document</a> does a good job of summarizing these.</p>
<p>Each anthill acts as a BLE Peripheral. The connection protocol is not
that complicated, but the code is somewhat messy as each step in the
protocol is asynchronous; that is, you make a call to perform some BLE
function, and some time later a callback is triggered in your
application to indicate that the function has completed.</p>
<p>The basic sequence is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start scanning for anthills</li>
<li>Once an anthill is discovered, connect to it</li>
<li>Once you have connected, discover its services</li>
<li>For each service, discover its characteristics</li>
<li>For each characteristic, check if it is the sensor data
characteristic; if it is, start listening for notifications to the state
of the characteristic</li>
<li>On each state update, process the received data to extract any
sensor readings.</li>
</ol>
<!-- Since each state update is at most 20 bytes, the anthill may fragment -->
<!-- one sensor reading across several packets. -->
<p>You will need to add several functions to <code>SensorModel</code> in
order to implement <code>BLEDelegate</code>:</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>func ble(didUpdateState state: BLEState)
func ble(didDiscoverPeripheral peripheral: CBPeripheral)
func ble(didConnectToPeripheral peripheral: CBPeripheral)
func ble(didDisconnectFromPeripheral peripheral: CBPeripheral)
func ble(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didReceiveData data: Data?)</code></pre>
<p>The SensorModel should inherit from <code>BLEDelegate</code>:</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>class SensorModel: BLEDelegate {
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>Once you add the <code>BLEDelegate</code> part to indicate that,
Xcode will suggest you to add protocol stubs. Press “Fix” in the red
error box to add the five function signatures automatically, or you can
add them manually too.</p>
<h3 id="task01">Task 1: Initialize Bluetooth, and Start Scanning for
Anthills</h3>
<p>Before you can scan for an anthill, you need to initialize a
<code>BLE</code> object. A good place to do this is in the
<code>init</code> method of <code>SensorModel</code>. Since you will
need access this object repeatedly, you probably want to declare it as
an instance variable of the class.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that after initializing the object, you will need to set
its delegate to the current SensorModel object:</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>ble.delegate = self</code></pre>
<p>Once you have created this object, the BLE will call
<code>ble(didUpdateState ...)</code> to indicate the status of
Bluetooth. You should check that the status is
<code>BLEState.poweredOn</code> and if it is, initiate scanning for
anthills.</p>
<p>To initiate scanning, call the <code>startScanning</code> method on
the <code>BLE</code> instance.</p>
<p>Once scanning has started, you will receive a callback to the
<code>BLEDelegate</code> method
<code>ble(didDiscoverPeripheral ...)</code>. You will need to define
this method in <code>SensorModel</code>, as per the signature in the
BLEDelegate protocol defined in <code>BLE.swift</code>.</p>
<p>To verify that this task is completed, use the debugger to confirm
<code>didUpdateState</code> is called and that the status is
<code>BLEState.poweredOn</code>. Also verify that when
<code>startScanning</code> is called in the presence of an anthill, you
receive a callback to <code>didDiscoverPeripheral</code>.</p>
<h3 id="task02">Task 2: Implement
<code>didDiscoverPeripheral</code></h3>
<p><code>didDiscoverPeripheral</code> will be called when a BLE
Peripheral advertising the above characteristic comes into proximity of
your phone. When this happens, you need to connect to device, and then
scan for services and characteristics.</p>
<p>When <code>didDiscoverPeripheral</code> is called, you are given a
handle to a <code>CBPeripheral</code> object. This is the peripheral you
want to try to connect to (in this lab, you are going to connect to the
first peripheral you discover, and stay connected to it until it moves
out of range, rather than trying to prioritize connecting to certain
anthills).</p>
<p>To connect to a peripheral, simply call
<code>connectToPeripheral</code>. If the connection is successful,
<code>didConnectToPeripheral</code> will be called. You will need to
define <code>didConnectToPeripheral</code>, as per the signature in
<code>BLE.swift</code>. Use the debugger to verify that this method is
called correctly.</p>
<h3 id="task03">Task 3: Implement
<code>didConnectToPeripheral</code></h3>
<p>Once you have connected to a peripheral, you will need to call the
delegate method <code>didChangeActiveHill</code>. The method takes an
instance of Hill, which is defined towards the top of
<code>SensorModel.swift</code> (the name of the Hill should be set to
<code>peripheral.name</code>). You should initialize a Hill and store it
in the <code>activeHill</code> instance variable, as the delegate will
expect the same Hill later for the <code>didReceiveReadings</code>
delegate method. You will also need to store the CBPeripheral in an
instance variable, as you will want to distinguish the peripheral
corresponding to activeHill from other peripherals.</p>
<p>After connecting to a peripheral, the <code>BLE</code> instance will
call the <code>discoverServices</code> function in the iOS BLE API;
then, after services are discovered, the <code>BLE</code> instance will
call <code>didDiscoverCharacteristicsForService</code> and handle
updates to the sensor data characteristic. Finally, the <code>BLE</code>
instance will request notifications for the sensor characteristic, and
the iOS API will call <code>didUpdateValueForCharacteristic</code> on
the <code>BLE</code> instance whenever a new packet of sensor data is
available. The <code>BLE</code> instance will then call
<code>didReceiveData</code> on the <code>SensorModel</code>.</p>
<p>To complete this task, verify that <code>didReceiveData</code> is
being called, e.g., by setting breakpoints in this method in the
debugger. If it is not called after about 30 seconds, see <a
href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sec2">Section 2: Extracting readings from an Anthill</h2>
<p>When a connection is established, the Anthill begins streaming
packets containing sensor data on the sensor data characteristic. You
will need to extract sensor readings from this characteristic and post
them to the application. (For the purposes of this lab, you do not
explicitly request any data or send any commands to the anthill.)</p>
<!-- The anthill sends a stream of ASCII characters, containing one of three -->
<!-- types of messages: humidity readings, temperature readings, and error -->
<!-- messages. Each message begins with a single letter, and then has a -->
<!-- custom payload. The messages are as follows: -->
<p>The anthill sends a stream of ASCII characters, containing one of two
types of messages: humidity readings and temperature readings. Each
message begins with a single letter, and then has a custom payload. The
messages are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘H’: humidity. The payload consists of an ASCII representation of
the percent relatively humidity, as a floating point number, followed by
a ‘D’, indicating the end of the number.</li>
<li>‘T’: temperature. The payload consists of an ASCII representation of
the temperature (in Fahrenheit), as a floating point number, followed by
a ‘D’, indicating the end of the number.
<!-- -   'E': an error, followed by an additional character indicating the -->
<!--     type of the error. (You can simply ignore error messages, but will -->
<!--     need to parse these messages.) If the Anthill continually sends -->
<!--     error packets, the connections betweeen the sensor and the board may -->
<!--     be loose. Check the connections, try connecting to a different -->
<!--     **GND** pin (there are three in total), or ask a TA for a new -->
<!--     Anthill/sensor. --></li>
</ul>
<!-- This stream of messages is fragmented into BLE packets that are up to 20 -->
<!-- bytes in length. Note that this means that a given message may be spread -->
<!-- across two BLE packets. You will receive one call to `didReceiveData` -->
<!-- for each packet, but will not necessarily be able to parse the entirety -->
<!-- of each packet and will need to save the unparsed bytes in a buffer -->
<!-- until additional bytes arrive. You might also start receiving data from -->
<!-- the middle of a packet. -->
<p>Each call to <code>didReceiveData</code> should correspond to one BLE
packet (humidity or temperature). Every two seconds, each anthill
attempts read the humidity and temperature values from the sensor and
send a pair of packets. However, because of loose connections or
imperfect sensor, the packets may not be sent every two seconds.</p>
<h3 id="task04">Task 4: Implement <code>didReceiveData</code></h3>
<p>To complete this task, implement code to extract messages from the
stream of packets delivered to <code>didReceiveData</code>.</p>
<p>Once you have extracted a sensor reading from the stream, create a
<code>Reading</code> object from it (set type to either
<code>ReadingType.Temperature</code> or
<code>ReadingType.Humidity</code>, and <code>sensorId</code> to
<code>peripheral.name</code>). You should add it to the
<code>activeHill</code>’s <code>readings</code> array, which the UI will
access to update its list of sensor readings. Call the delegate method
<code>didReceiveReadings</code>, so that the delegate is notified of the
new readings.</p>
<p>You might find these code snippets useful:</p>
<pre class="swift"><code>// convert a non-nil Data optional into a String
let str = String(data: data!, encoding: String.Encoding.ascii)!

// get a substring that excludes the first and last characters
let substring = str[str.index(after: str.startIndex)..&lt;str.index(before: str.endIndex)]

// convert a Substring to a Double
let value = Double(substring)!</code></pre>
<p>This task is complete when you can see sensor readings streaming into
sensor reading display on the Anteater Readings screen, as shown
below:</p>
<center>
<img src="images/lab2/readings.png" width="300" />
</center>
<h3 id="task05">Task 5: Implement
<code>didDisconnectFromPeripheral</code></h3>
<p>When the connected hill is powered off,
<code>didDisconnectFromPeripheral</code> will be called. If the provided
peripheral matches the one corresponding to the <code>activeHill</code>,
you should reset <code>activeHill</code> to <code>nil</code> then call
<code>didChangeActiveHill</code> with <code>nil</code>, so that the
delegate is notified that there is no longer any connected hill. Lastly,
initiate scanning to start scanning for new connections.</p>
<p>To verify, disconnect the anthill from power and check that the
readings are no longer displayed. Then, connect the anthill to power and
check that your phone automatically reconnects with the anthill and
displays the new readings once the connection is established.</p>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>While it is unlikely to happen, if you suspect that no packets are
being sent despite correct sensor connections, you can debug it by
following the instructions below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the Arduino board to your computer</li>
<li>Install the <a
href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino IDE</a></li>
<li>Go to Tools &gt; Board &gt; select “Arduino NANO 33 IoT”</li>
<li>Go to Tools &gt; Port &gt; select an option that ends with “(Arduino
NANO 33 IoT)”</li>
<li>Go to Tools &gt; Serial Monitor</li>
</ul>
<p>You should see a window that prints “HELLO WORLD” every two seconds
and the temperature and humidity value pairs every time the packets are
sent (<a href="images/lab2/serial_monitor.png">reference</a>). If your
iPhone app fails to detect any packet after implementing it in Xcode and
the Serial Monitor does not show the messages as described, please
contact us to get a new board and sensor.</p>
<h2 id="submission">Submission and Checkoff Instructions</h2>
<p>Write up your answers to the following items in a single PDF file and
name it <strong>lab2_${mit_username}.pdf</strong> or
<strong>lab2_${mit_username1}+${mit_username2}.pdf</strong> if you work
with a partner (e.g. lab2_mihirt.pdf or lab2_mihirt+bnagda.pdf). Upload
the PDF file to Gradescope by <strong>Mar 11, 11:59 PM</strong>. If you
work with a partner, you only have to submit once, but each partner must
each do a checkoff. You can get a checkoff during Office Hours within a
week after the submission deadline, i.e. Mar 18, 11:59 PM. You do not
need to submit your code, but we may ask to look at your code during the
checkoff.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Names and MIT emails (including your lab partner, if available)</li>
<li>How does a central (your phone) discover a peripheral (an
anthill)?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between a peripheral, a service, and a
