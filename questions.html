                Suppose we want to send data from node S to node T in a multi-hop wireless network. The probability of
                successfully receiving an ACK for a packet sent from S to T directly is q. The other choice is to use an
                intermediate node, N; the probability of successfully receiving an ACK for a packet from S to N is p,
                the same as the probability of successfully receiving an ACK for a packet sent from N to T. Using ETX,
                under what conditions would the direct link from S to T be preferred to the path S — N — T?

                A simple method to detect potholes would be to look at time windows during which the absolute magnitude
                of the acceleration vector is above some threshold. This will lead to a number of false positives, as
                described in the paper. After reading the paper, list two sources of such false positives, and how the
                paper proposes to address them.

                (1) Why can't we build robust crash rate models by simply using the locations of prior crashes alone?
                <br><br>
                (2) What key inputs does the paper use to build crash rate maps?

                Please read the vital radio paper and answer the following questions:
                <br><br>
                (1) We learned that WiTrack's accuracy is about 10cm. Further, we learned that the resolution of FMCW is
                C/2B, where C is the speed of light and B is the bandwidth. VitalRadio uses the same FMCW radio that
                WiTrack uses. So how is it possible for VitalRadio to measure movements as small as the chest
                inhale-exhale motion?
                <br><br>
                (2) VitalRadio can measure sub-centimeter motion. Can one use that technique to improve trajectory
                resolution in WiTrack to localize a person to within sub-centimeter accuracy? Explain your answer.

                (1) Why does Mapster outperform prior approaches in Boston and Chicago, but perform comparably in Salt
                Lake City?
                <br><br>
                (2) How does the cGAN refine inferred data? Why do we need to refine it in the first place?

                worried that one of their colleagues may use his cell phone to record the conversation at the meeting.
                Alice claims
                that she and Ben can use the technique in the paper to prevent such recording. Is Alice right? Explain
                your answer.
