                The article describes the danger of surveillance using AirTags. In principle, Apple can detect any AirTag moving with someone's iPhone and alert them about it.

                Suppose we want to send data from node S to node T in a multi-hop wireless network. The probability of
                successfully receiving an ACK for a packet sent from S to T directly is q. The other choice is to use an
                intermediate node, N; the probability of successfully receiving an ACK for a packet from S to N is p,
                the same as the probability of successfully receiving an ACK for a packet sent from N to T. Using ETX,
                under what conditions would the direct link from S to T be preferred to the path S — N — T?

                A simple method to detect potholes would be to look at time windows during which the absolute magnitude
                of the acceleration vector is above some threshold. This will lead to a number of false positives, as
                described in the paper. After reading the paper, list two sources of such false positives, and how the
                paper proposes to address them.
